## Overview

Convert CTA buttons to hyperlinks in the second section

## Original Request

In the 2nd section where all the CTA buttons are there, change them to hyperlinks.

---

Now I have all the context I need. Let me create the implementation plan:

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Summary
Convert the styled CTA buttons (with gradient backgrounds and shadows) in the 2nd section to simple text hyperlinks, similar to the existing "hero-link" style used in the first section. This involves changing the CSS class and potentially creating a new link style for CTA sections.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Create new CTA hyperlink styles in globals.css**
  - Add a new `.cta-link` class in `/webhook-server/app/globals.css` after the existing CTA button styles (around line 381)
  - Style should be similar to `.hero-link` but sized appropriately for the CTA sections
  - Include: text color using `--color-primary-indigo`, no background, underline animation on hover, proper focus states
  - Ensure the link is visually prominent but not button-styled
  - Acceptance: New `.cta-link` class exists with hover/focus states, no gradient background or box-shadow

- [ ] **Task 2: Update the 2nd section CTA in page.tsx**
  - Modify `/webhook-server/app/page.tsx` lines 28-39
  - Change `className="cta-button"` to `className="cta-link"` on the anchor tag
  - Remove the wrapping `<span>` element (no longer needed for z-index stacking)
  - Acceptance: The "Create a new page on 1000pages.navan.ai" link uses the new hyperlink style

- [ ] **Task 3: Verify visual appearance and accessibility**
  - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
  - Visually confirm the 2nd section displays a hyperlink instead of a button
  - Verify the 3rd and 4th sections still show as buttons (they should NOT be changed per the issue)
  - Test hover and focus states work correctly
  - Test in both light and dark modes if the site supports theming
  - Acceptance: Link is visually distinct from buttons, hover/focus states work, accessibility maintained

- [ ] **Task 4: Clean up unused CSS if needed**
  - Review if the `.cta-button span` styles are still needed (used by 3rd and 4th sections)
  - Ensure no orphaned styles remain
  - Acceptance: CSS is clean with no dead code

### Technical Considerations
- The existing `.hero-link` style (lines 282-316 in globals.css) provides a good reference for hyperlink styling with animated underline on hover
- The 3rd and 4th sections also use `.cta-button` - per the issue, only the **2nd section** should change, so those should remain as buttons
- The CTA sections have a secondary background color (`--color-bg-secondary`) - ensure the link color has sufficient contrast
- The `<span>` wrapper in the current button was added for z-index stacking with the hover overlay - it's not needed for a simple hyperlink

### Dependencies
- No external dependencies required
- Existing CSS custom properties (variables) should be reused for consistency

### Estimated Complexity
**Simple** - This is a straightforward CSS class addition and a single HTML attribute change. The existing `.hero-link` pattern provides a clear template to follow.
