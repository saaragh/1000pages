## Original Request

Create a new link to https://google.com/ in the 2nd section of the page

Now I have a clear understanding of the codebase structure. Let me create a detailed implementation plan.

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Summary
Add a new hyperlink to Google (https://google.com/) in the 2nd section of the homepage. The page already has an established pattern of CTA sections with styled links featuring animated underlines, so this is a straightforward addition following existing conventions.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Add Google Link to 2nd Section**
  - Open `/tmp/sam-repos/saaragh/1000pages/webhook-server/app/page.tsx`
  - Locate the 2nd section (first `cta-section` after the hero, lines ~28-39)
  - Add a new `<section className="cta-section">` block with the Google link **after** the existing 2nd section (or replace based on product decision)
  - Use the established link pattern:
    ```jsx
    <section className="cta-section">
      <div className="cta-content">
        <a 
          href="https://google.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          className="cta-link"
        >
          Visit Google
        </a>
      </div>
    </section>
    ```
  - Acceptance: Google link appears in the 2nd section with proper external link attributes (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`)

- [ ] **Task 2: Verify Link Styling & Behavior**
  - Confirm the link uses the existing `.cta-link` class (no custom CSS needed)
  - Verify animated underline appears on hover
  - Verify color transitions from indigo to purple on hover
  - Test in both light and dark modes
  - Acceptance: Link matches the visual styling of other CTA links on the page

- [ ] **Task 3: Test Responsiveness**
  - Test link display on desktop (>768px)
  - Test link display on tablet (768px breakpoint)
  - Test link display on mobile (480px breakpoint)
  - Acceptance: Link is readable and clickable at all viewport sizes

- [ ] **Task 4: Verify Link Functionality**
  - Click the link and confirm it opens https://google.com/ in a new tab
  - Verify no console errors or warnings
  - Acceptance: Link navigates correctly to Google in a new browser tab

### Technical Considerations
- **External Link Security**: Use `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to prevent reverse tabnapping vulnerabilities (already the pattern used by other external links)
- **No CSS Changes Required**: The existing `.cta-link` class in `globals.css` (lines 332-374) provides all necessary styling including hover animations and dark mode support
- **Section Ordering**: Clarify with stakeholder whether the Google link should *replace* the current 2nd section content or be *inserted* as a new section

### Dependencies
- None. All required CSS classes and patterns already exist in the codebase.

### Estimated Complexity
**Simple** - This is a single-line JSX addition following an already-established pattern. All styling, animations, and responsive behavior are inherited from existing CSS. No new components, no new styles, no configuration changes.
